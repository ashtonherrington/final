            Hello! My name is Ashton Herrington. That's me, shown right, next to my lovely fiance, Dr. Allison Sumis. 
            <br><br>
            I am currently a Computer Science major at Oregon State University. Prior to my matriculation at Oregon State, I studied and worked in the field of Molecular Biology. I received my Bachelors and Masters degrees both in Molecular Biology from George Mason University and Johns Hopkins University, respectively. 
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, the saturated job market for Biology majors led me to persue a career change that would keep me intellectually stimulated while providing adequate compensation for my family and I. I chose computer science both because I thought it would both fit these parameters, but also because I have loved and used computers since I was a young child. I have constructed computers for many years, but had never delved in to software development.
            <br><br>
            I'm currently about halfway done with my Computer Science major, and have maintained a 4.0 GPA thusfar. My classload has consisted of: Intro to C++, Advanced C++, Discrete Mathematics, Usability Engineering, Data Strutures, Web Development, and Assembly Langauage. I hope to graduate early-to-mid 2016. Being a fan of logic puzzles, I absolutely love coding and am very happy with my new career choice. 
            <br><br>
            The purpose of this page is two fold: To share my hobbies and useful programs with family, friends and colleagues and to shamelessly advertise myself to prospective employers. Please look around! If you have any questions feel free to contact me at ashtonherrington.ah@gmail.com. If you are a prospective employer and would like access to my code, please contact me and I will provide you with Login credentials to allow you access.
            <br><br>
            Why hire me? I have a strong work ethic, a sharp mind, and the maturity to effectively work in team enviroments with little to no drama. Despite being new to computer science, I do have real world job experience in both the roles of team member and a team manager. I am highly motivated and have a proven track record that I can work effectively with little to no supervision required. I am not meek, and if ever requested will offer suggestions to help move my own and my team's projects forward. Lastly, I am loyal and consider my own worth only as good as my word. If I tell you I will get something done, it will be done - no excuses.
